# Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks
Image recognition (digits 0 - 9 from the MNIST dataset) using Sequential and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Data
The <b>training data</b> consists of 60000 images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, together with up to 1600 images drawn manually in a tkinter GUI that was developed here, and 42000 images from the Kaggle machine learning competition ["Digit Recognizer"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/).
The <b>testing data</b> consists of 10000 MNIST images with known labels and 28000 Kaggle images without labels for competition scoring.
<b>Format</b>: images have black background and white-grey digits. Digits are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value from 0 (black) to 255 (white). There are 10 classes, one for each digit.

## Scoring of hyperparameters
Neural networks were scored in three ways:
+ using 10000 MNIST test images,
+ by hand-writing digits in a tkinter Graphical User Interface (GUI),
+ by comparing labels predicted for 28000 Kaggle images with the true labels (undisclosed) that I obtained by reaching the 100% prediction accuracy in the competition.

## User feedback via GUI
User feedback is enabled via a tkinter <b>GUI</b> created here and allowing user to draw a digit using mouse, see its neural network model-generated classification as one of the digits, allow specifying a correct label in case it is misclassified, save the misclassified image and its label for model re-training, and keep track of prediction accuracy. The GUI is implemented using Tkinter library that comes in the Python standard library. The App class is responsible for building the GUI for our app. It has a canvas where one can draw by capturing the mouse event. Functions are triggered by pushing control buttons: button 'Clear' clears canvas and button 'Recognise' activates the function predict_digit() to recognize the digit. This function takes the image as input and then uses the trained model to predict the digit. The predicted label and its probability percentage are displayed.
#### Instructions for GUI:
1. Start by drawing a digit in the canvas window (60 x 60 pixels).
